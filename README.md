Users login. If he is not a member of the system, he first registers. After logging in, he can view the tools in the system. This display screen contains various information such as whether the vehicles are suitable for rental, the class of the vehicle (economy, luxury, etc.), daily rental fee. When the user selects any vehicle suitable for rent, the rental screen appears. The rental process is completed by entering the rental location and the number of days to be rented.
